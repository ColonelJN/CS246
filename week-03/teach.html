        <p class="subtitle">Parsing JSON</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Become familiar with JSON.</p></li>
            <li><p>Understand how to deserialize JSON into objects and collections.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <h4>Part I: Understanding JSON</h4>
        <p>JSON is a data storage format originally developed for web applications. It has become one of the most popular data exchange formats because of its compact size and readability. (Another popular data format is XML. If you're interested, you can read more about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4862511/28106">the pros and cons of the two here</a>.</p>

        <p>Here is what an array looks like in JSON:</p>

<pre><code class="json">// Array of numbers 
[ 1, 2, 3, 4]

// Array of strings
[ "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun"]

// Array of booleans:
[ true, false, true, true]
</code></pre>

        <p>JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation". Even though we can use it to store simple arrays, it's designed to allow complex objects to be stored in key-value pairs.</p>
        <p>The keys are strings that correspond to the property names, and the values are the values of the property for a particular object:</p>

<pre><code class="java">// Player object 
Player p = new Player();
p.setName("Steve");
p.setHealth(20);
p.setMana(50);
p.setCanFly(false);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="json">// JSON Representation 
{ "name": "Steve", "health": 20, "mana": 50, "canFly": false}
</code></pre>

        <p>We can take an object, <em>serialize</em> into JSON, and then share that data, (either in a file or by sending it over the network. Then we can <em>deserialize</em> it back into an object.</p>

        <h4>Part II: Use the GSON Library</h4>
        <p>Unfortunately, Java doesn't have built-in support for JSON, so to parse it we have use a 3rd party library. There are several available, but we'll be using <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">Google's GSON library</a> (GSON just stands for "Google JSON", it isn't a different data format).</p>

        <p>We'll be using a pre-compiled <em>jar</em> version of the library. A <em>jar</em> file is like a zip file containing a bunch of compiled java classes. It's how java programs and libraries are typically shared.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>To begin, download this sample project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read through the comments in the code to understand what is happening.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To compile the code, navigate to the directory containing the java files and execute this command:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">javac -cp "./lib/gson-2.8.0.jar" *.java
</code></pre>

                <p>The <code>-cp</code> flag means "Class path", and it allows to tell the compiler where it can find extra code we want to reference when we compile.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Unlike C++, Java doesn't include the library permanently in our code. This means we still need to reference it when we execute the code:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">java -cp ".;./lib/gson-2.8.0.jar" Parser
</code></pre>

                <p>In this case, the <code>-cp</code> flag tells the Java runtime everywhere we want it to look for code. We tell it to first look in the current directory (<code>.</code>) and to also look in the GSON jar file in the lib directory (<code>./lib/gson-2.8.0.jar</code>).</p>

                <p>The <code>;</code> is just a separator between each location. (If you're running <code>java</code> on a mac or linux computer, you'll need to use a <code>:</code> for your path separator rather than <code>;</code>).
            </li>

        </ol>
