        <h2>06 Team : Risk Mitigation</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Attempt to mitigate the risks identified last week.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
        <p>This week, for your team project, you need to do the research or proof of concept work that you identified last week to help mitigate the biggest risks to your project. This does not mean that you have to finish the entire project this week, but rather that you should become more familiar with pieces that were previously unknown.</p>

        <p>The goal is that by the end of this week, you can verify that there is a way to accomplish the task at hand, and you have a basic idea of how to go about it. Then, we will spend the rest of the semester building out the complete projects using these ideas.</p>


        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Submit one document per team listing each risk identified last week, the steps that were taken to mitigate that risk, and briefly summarize what you learned. This does not need to be lengthy, but should probably be about a paragraph per item..</p>
